# AquaViewer

A WebUI for AQUA Server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Self Host
Due to modern browser's security restriction, there is no simple way to self host like old days.

- To serve local instance: install NodeJS and required dependencies respectively then run `ng serve`.

- To build: same as above but run `ng build --prod`.

For static images, place them into assets folder. Otherwise, all related images won't display.

Please follow the [deployment guide](https://angular.io/guide/deployment) if you are new to angular.
